# üö® **Serverless Deployment Limitation** 

## Issue: Lighthouse Audits on Vercel

Unfortunately, **full Lighthouse audits with Chrome browser are not supported on Vercel's serverless platform** due to resource limitations:

- **Memory Constraints**: Chrome requires more RAM than serverless functions provide
- **Execution Time**: Lighthouse audits can exceed serverless function timeouts  
- **Browser Dependencies**: Puppeteer + Chrome not available in serverless environment

## ‚úÖ **Solutions**

### 1. **Local Development (Recommended)**
Run the full-featured application locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [repository-url]
cd lighthouse-webapp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

**Benefits of Local Setup:**
- ‚úÖ Full Lighthouse functionality
- ‚úÖ Faster audit processing
- ‚úÖ AI insights generation
- ‚úÖ No timeout limitations
- ‚úÖ Complete CSV processing

### 2. **Alternative Hosting**
Consider platforms that support full Node.js applications:

- **Railway**: `railway deploy`
- **Render**: Direct deployment from Git
- **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Container-based deployment
- **AWS EC2**: Full control over environment
- **Google Cloud Run**: Container deployment

### 3. **Hybrid Approach**
Use Vercel for the frontend and a separate service for Lighthouse:

- **Frontend**: Deploy UI to Vercel
- **API**: Deploy Lighthouse service to Railway/Render
- **Configuration**: Update API endpoints in environment variables

## üîß **Current Vercel Deployment**

The deployed version at https://lighthousechecker-[hash].vercel.app provides:

- ‚úÖ Beautiful dark navy + yellow UI
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling  
- ‚ùå **Lighthouse audits disabled** (graceful error message shown)
- ‚úÖ Demonstrates complete application architecture

## üìã **User Guidance**

When users try to run audits on Vercel, they'll see:

> **Lighthouse audits are not supported on serverless platforms due to Chrome browser requirements. Please run the application locally for full functionality.**

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

The application includes:

- **Serverless Detection**: Automatically detects Vercel environment
- **Graceful Degradation**: Shows helpful error instead of crashing
- **Local Compatibility**: Full functionality when running locally
- **Resource Management**: Optimized for both environments
